The goal of this project is to develop, document, and validate an open-source Python pipeline that replicates standard survival analysis methods—Kaplan-Meier estimation, log-rank tests, and Cox proportional hazards models—commonly implemented in SAS and R. By comparing outputs across platforms using consistent datasets and predefined numeric agreement criteria, the project ensures reproducibility, transparency, and regulatory-grade equivalence of statistical results. This work lays the foundation for broader acceptance of Python-based workflows in clinical research and potential future FDA submissions.
